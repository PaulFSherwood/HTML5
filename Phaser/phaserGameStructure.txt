# assets/ : Stores all image, audio and spritesheet assets.  Organizing by type (e.g., images, audio) helps quickly find assets and reduce clutter.
# src/scenes/ : 
	# TitleScene.js : Handles the title screen, character selectin, and basic settings.  This is the entry scene when the game starts
	# GameOverScene.js : Handels game-over screen logic and display, with options to restart or return to the title screen.
# src/characters/ :
	# Player.js : Contains player character movement, animations, attacks and health.  Player-specific behaviros are defined here.
	# Enemy.js : Similar to Player.js, but for enemy charaters.  Can handle movement patters, attacks and death animations.
# src/ui/ :
	# HUD.js : Manages UI elements like health bars, score counters, and any other in-game status indicators.
# src/systems/ :
	# CombatSystemjs : Handles attack logic, hit detection, damage calculation.  This keeps the core combat logic modular
	# EnemnySpawner.js : Controls when and where enemies spwn, allowing for waves or timed spawn as players progress
	# CollisionSystem.js : Manages collision detection and response between the player, enemies, and environment.
# src/utils/ :
	# HelperFunctions.js : Gneral utility functions that can be used across different files, such as random number generators or helper functions for loading assets.
# src/main.js: This is the main entry point of your Phaser game.  It sets up the Phaser configuration (vanvas size, physics settings, etc.) and launches the initial scene (e.g., TitleScene).

#######
By structuring it this way, each folder and file has a specific responsibity, making it easier to manage and debug individual components without getting overwhelmed by a large script file.  You can use this approach to make the code modular and organized for easy navigation and future maintenance.
